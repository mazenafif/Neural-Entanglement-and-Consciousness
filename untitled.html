<h1>Introduction<br></h1><div>Much research discussed disease problems, especially in accordance with the different theories relating to the nerves, and in a way is expensive and complex in terms of them take a lot of time and money too. Sometimes, it may give positive results and at other times be insignificant compared to the results of expenditures (money and time, etc), in any case, researchers have made great efforts to explain the ambiguity of certain issues such as awareness and so I will continue the pace in order that we can even add a little of the solutions to such issues. Thus, I went in accordance with the different ideas for the vision and light, where dealing with neural engineering to humans in terms of the mechanism are ideas of all kinds and genetic function on which was built the map neural Human Reproduction, as well as its evolution in the future, despite the lack of a lot of media owned by other studies (e.g., laboratories and money and who are screened through them and experience the results). Overall this research, which is based on the conclusion by observation and experiment and measurement along with what came with previous studies. And it was able to draw a spectral map touted biochemical reactions within milliseconds well they match the brain architecture, and the structure of other nerve cells, for that the effect is the synthesis of molecules through the accumulation of quantitative electromagnetic signals and electrochemical (energy) and converted (replication processes) to a matter, and vice versa. Is the brain deals with information encountered according to previous information, or that the human brain has been programmed in accordance with the pre-cognitive function, with the ability to analyze and manipulate Although there is no op is equal with that new information? Why create a human brain with this structural conformation, and how consistent biological processes in various body with that? What is the relationship between the structure and the processes of bio-synthesis? Is vision three-dimensional objects occur in the brain or in an area outside the brain? <br></div><div>The mathematical term “ill posed” means that additional constraints are needed to solve the prob- lem. Although the main function of the visual system is to per- ceive objects and events in the world around us, the informa- tion available to our eyes is not sufficient by itself to provide the brain with its unique interpretation of the visual world (Crick, Koch,1992).&nbsp;Furthermore, there are consistency and functional coordination complementary between the nerves of sight and hearing, where it appears by understanding and analyzing the frequencies, captured by the sensory receptors in the eye and the ear, with the participation of the heart, where its role is in the production of synchronization molecules, that containing affinity (the heart's response, which are accepted or rejected synchronization), and transmitted through the fork of the common carotid arteries, such as "Arteria ophthalmica" that around the eye. And thus it may be the realization part of those frequencies — while other part remain unknown. And may other cells (which have sensors nervous scattered on the body), be able to perception and analysis of the mysterious side of those frequencies, (difference wavelengths). There is something to be as a fingerprint system, handles the heart through a nervous special coding is why we see the reaction when you hear the music, regardless of the words, but more important is the musical notation and which uses a trumpet. Where it is plotted harmonic function of the heart rhythm and the musical notes, by doing this is to get rid of negative electrochemical signals are carried by paths, (neural-dynamic). Also it is not limited to music, but also the good word that comes from the ethics, that God ordered us; because of their dynamic effects to humans entity, moreover, each audio frequency (Speech) has neural-fractalprint, remain for a certain period, and accumulate through association with compatible and identical frequencies, so arises doubling the acoustic energy, even be able to bring about a psychological adjustments. This is quite similar to the electric charging “Neuroplasticity”, of auditory nerve fibers (by which increases the effects of acoustic energy) directly proportional to the neural entropy (accompaniment thermal frequencies), when immutability the density of gray matter. “The firing of cortical neurons is strongly correlated with the firing of hippocampal neurons around ripple and spindle events, and there is a distinct tendency for hippocampal spikes to precede prefrontal spikes. [2] Thus, the change in the physiology of neurons suited to the changing times according to the phases of simultaneous dynamically. Neural synapses groups (visual and audio frequency as network), in the form of galaxies, that working on the translation of orders from the heart. When listening to music, neurons interact especially those in the heart, which is responsible for recognizing and addressing the encoding auditory and give a reaction (cellular response). Although neurons do not bother with words — are also interested in musical notepad, (e.g., hip-hop music, with trumpet, etc). Because music instrumental and deliver a neurological response is the synthesis of hormones such as serotonin, etc. The nerve cells sometimes need to absorb private musical Energy, which chosen by the person according to neuromagnetic and those desires just translate to the cells need, (self-instructing cellular), which play a role in re-adjust neural entropy to make a neural-dynamic equilibrium. But a lot of listening leads to negative reaction, translates into physiological changes those operations quite similar to the&nbsp; cells, and since a lot of eating leads to digestive problems as well as a lot of music, leads to physiological changes, especially when the directives of the involuntary nervous are unwilling to listen, (this means that human beings just multi-being). The brain must use past experience (either its own or that of our dis- tant ancestors, which is embedded in our genes) to help inter- pret the information coming into our eyes (Crick, Koch,1992).&nbsp;Therefore, the consistency of biological processes such as awareness occur due to synergy between optical frequencies, and audio frequency, associated with the heart's response (quantropism), that according to previous information the brain, and nerve synapses in the body. Thus, each audio frequency (Speech) has neural-fingerprint, remain for a certain period and accumulate through association with compatible and identical frequencies, so arises doubling the acoustic energy, even be able to bring about a psychological adjustments. This is quite similar to the electric charging. Compulsive-neuroplasticity of auditory nerve fibers (by which increases the effects of acoustic energy), directly proportional to the neural entropy (accompaniment thermal frequencies), when immutability the density of gray matter. For this, the change in the physiology of neurons (that in the heart, brain), suited to the changing times according to the phases of simultaneous dynamically — Neural genes capable of synaptic change (causing compulsive-neuroplasticity), seems that stimulate the secretion of “ADH”, associated with the activity of the auditory association of a person who is exposed to the obsessive-compulsive syndrome, as the sound plays a role in the hormonal and nervous regulation of the heart, and this effect is transmitted via the carotid artery to the brain, eye and nose. Constitute the "carotid artery" and "jugular vein" with the vagus nerve common strand up through the neck to the head, and is surrounded by this rope connective tissue being between neck muscles.&nbsp; " Severe lesions of the central cell cluster of the VLPO (∼80–90% cell loss bilaterally) caused a 60–70% decrease in delta power and a 50–60% decrease in nonrapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep time (p&lt; 0.001).The number of remaining Fos-immunoreactive neurons in the VLPO cell cluster was linearly related to NREM sleep time (r = 0.77; p &lt; 0.001) and total electroencephalogram delta power (r = 0.79;p &lt; 0.001) but not to rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep (r = 0.35; p &gt; 0.10) (Lu, Greco, Shiromani, &amp; Saper, 2000). Furthermore, the heart plays a role in brain function, especially by carotid artery, which carries the familiar coupling with sleep waves, through magnetic stimulation of the sleep receptors,&nbsp; that resides in dormancy phase, and also there is a time frequency receptors which rotates in form fractal around the body. The impact of speech on the physiology of the individual — for each word impact strength, and that strength is proportional to the "neuralplasticity", when the coupling phase synchronization. <br></div><div>Blindsight implies a sharp dissociation between visual performance and visual awareness, but signal detection theory indicates that it might be indistinguishable from the behavior of normal subjects near the lower limit of conscious vision, where the dissociations could arise trivially from using different response criteria during clinical and forced-choice tests (Azzopardi, Cowey, 1998). The blind spot in each eye is caused by the lack of photore- ceptors in the area of the retina where the optic nerve leaves the retina and projects to the brain.[1, 3, 7] Another study showing the role of the frontparietal lobe of the brain awareness.<br></div><div>"These results suggest that frontoparietal areas play a central role in conscious perception, biasing the content of visual awareness toward abstract internal representations of visual scenes, rather than simply toward space.[8]&nbsp;Thus, the conjunctiva (Sclera), play a role in the mechanism of awareness and understanding of the rest of wavelengths, while the eye's pupil cannot understand that. As the biological processes mechanism in the brain are in accordance with the grating structure (neural entanglement) there is an inverse operations in the lobes of the brain complementary with electrochemical signals from the nerves of hearing, so that the structure and molecular arrangement and coding in repositioning become true (the accumulation of quantitative information at a certain angle) and then optic chiasm. As well as the frontal lobe contains the most sensitive nerve of dopamine cells in the cerebral cortex. Another study conducted on cats show the optic nerve and the auditory nerve relationship."Electrodes were chronically implanted in the optic nerve of cats and indeed such efferent responses were evoked by auditory and tactile stimuli"&nbsp;(Spinelli, Pribram, &amp; Weingarten, 1965).<br></div><div>Moreover, Schizophrenia is not a disease, but as a result of the evolution of neural gene, (sensory receptors), especially the analysis and translation of the neural text encoding. Auditory hallucinations and delusions are core symptoms of schizophrenia, which interact with each other, (Shiraishi, Watanabe, Kinoshita, Kaneko, Yoshida, Furukawa, &amp; Akechi, 2014). Further, when a person cannot contain this phenomenon will turn into negative behavior, “iff” was combined with the kidneys inflammation, (as resulting from the increase in the negative quantum in the heart, whether those negatives turned into a quasi neurotransmitter or to certain familiarity), and then lead to the wrong conclusion. The synthesis of anti-ADH, and leads to increased urination a smell, due to the increased proportion of urea, as well as if the symptoms continue for a long time will git strain the heart muscle. <br></div><div><b>Hypothesis</b><br></div><div>1- There are coalition nervous as Pentagon shape, and each pair nervous plays a role in the analyze and manipulation of sensory signals according to the reversible complex function (to and from), and it may rebel against one of them (negative or positive evolution), as a result of the practice of behavior for a long time, and then sends the illusion to the central coalition.<br></div><div>2-  There are the  electrodynamagnetic sensory of heart, so the heart that controls bio-compass whatever he wants, according to molecular quantum started in heart cells responsible for the cellular receptors cognition mechanism, and therefore will not be allowed unless the frequencies that correspond to the processes of the interactions of these bio-receptors on the membrane over the pericardium, this is one of the types of consciousness.<br></div><div>3-&nbsp;The  bio-synthesis of genes or protein, etc, begins in the eyes according to the principle of conservation of structure and audio frequencies (as auditory fingerprint).&nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div><h2>Materials and Methods<br></h2><div>Crystalline construction of sight in the form of the spectral entanglement&nbsp; .<br></div><div>And the relationship of that to the eye, auditory nerve, heart, brain,&nbsp; liver, and the bottom of the body. Described the biological processes that are located outside of the body, especially between the eye, the ear, the heart and the brain. Relationship between those of previous studies, and the way this method to become the article, in the form of a logical formulas,  therefore this article to be in accordance with the inductive approach, descriptive, the conclusion, according to the observation of the behavior of individuals as well as experience, where deals spectrometer sight, to explain the ambiguity of the biological processes of consciousness.<br></div><div><br></div><h3>Conclusions and Results&nbsp;<br></h3><div>In particular in this article is not available images and graphs as well, but others may be able to drawn through their understanding of the content as well as enable them to derive new principles to manipulate some of the important issues. Then, this case interpretation of the role of the synapses of the harmonization of the nerves of hearing and sight, and the relationship of that awareness. Also interpret the essence of Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia, according to the rational function describing the dynamic and chemical processes experienced by the electrochemical signals during the stages of synthesis which will last for millisecond before they resume another round opposite passing through the liver and the heart and the bottom (reproduction) and the impact on "DNA", through the effects accompany ( individual and influential external response), which have the ability to cause genetic alterations. And the individual who controls allow those signals in conjunction or to be rejected and thus have control involuntarily for synchronized by the individual himself. Therefore, the charge of the occurrence of genetic modifications is the individual himself unconsciously, when an individual is exposed to low frequencies (which resemble modern psychology), and then the occurrence response from the auditory heart cells, for those frequencies, and then undergone alert involuntarily from the heart, realizes alarm as a feeling thinking (awarness), coincided with the movement of the eyes in accordance with the direction and structure so influential (dance by fractals motion) and that from which alert the individual that there is noticeable, even to the individual's approval or rejection.<br></div><div>Note that those signals carry encoding nervous has the ability to bring about genetic modification if and only if the individual has agreed to it and underwent those processes and then is that the encoding of forcing an individual to launch nervous orders revisionism synchronizing (neural-license) with the influential in order to facilitate the movement and the transition between the neurons, and thus to control the synthesis of proteins according to the will of the influential. While every step synthesis be with the consent of the individual unconsciously, and this is what is known as nervous collapse, which will cause some individuals to commit suicide or obsessive-compulsive disorder syndrome, the impact happens after a similar synthesis operations (sync involuntarily), continue for several days before being translated to an actual modification.<br></div><div>Everyone has magnetic fields in the form of spectral entanglement contains &nbsp;physiological results, as well as the behavior, and the mutual understanding between individuals involuntary through magnetic fields, which contains a copy of genetic traits and this is what is so-called reading ideas.<br></div><div>The eye is the synthesis of the structural, and Cellular cognition area, (sensation and cognition). "There are types of dopamine receptors. Depends dopamine effects on where emitted in it, and the quantity to be launched", as well as on the types of receptors that have been activated, so the heart plays a role in the production of neurotransmitters sensitive to dopamine where the complementary mechanism with visual and auditory untangling also contain dopamine receptors and that are related to schizophrenia temporary.<br></div><div>The individual is affected by those phantom sounds (negative thoughts), if and only if, it coincided with the dynamics of the eye, which play a role in reading the waveform coding during the self-synthesis of molecules (so the eye is moving in a different direction) and then manipulate with previous information in the frontal lobe of the brain, and pelvic region especially the reproductive system of the individual, where increasing effects when it is associated with kidney infections. Furthermore, the individual can get rid of those phantom sounds, through rational function bound, — so it seems the effect of positioning those frequencies, and from this that bio-process it shows the self-synthesis as a result of the accumulation of quantitative as well as it is affected by a time synchronization at a certain positioning.<br></div><div>Consciousness is a multiple optical audio frequencies within the time frequency (wavelengths anastomosis), resulting from the fork of time (past and future), and are subject to these wave frequencies to simulate the neural entanglement of the eye (which is in the form of optical anastomosis), in sync with the heart molecules that exist in the forest carotid artery, a round eye and neck, etc, to be reproduced and recognized in the nervous coalition (after they are synthesized by the quantitative accumulation in various neurological couples branching in the body), and then transported to the brain and heart in the form of certain polymers to keep aware of the lobes of the brain optic chiasm. Compulsive consciousness may arise due to thermal objects are deluding audio sensors in order to be a reaction (cellular response of the heart) and after they are pairing it starts with the negative impact of the colonization and programming of the cell membranes in the heart, which controls the communication between the interior of the cell and outside, are not allowed frequencies over except that correspond with him (bio-tuning), as it seems in the case of injury obsessive-compulsive disorder. Awareness is a wave frequencies, Self-complementarity combining molecules needed in the position of quantitative tangles, are trends in the quark flavors, which enabled it to fit according able to move in a rational function geometric angles unlike pi. As the molecules are formed during microseconds as well as disintegrate. A memory in the eye and hearing share during synchronization with awareness. Where there is a kind of attraction as a result of the fork of time to form dipolar bond.<br></div><div>Through the optical wave structure shows that the position of light source affects the mood of the individual, so it should be placed lighting source in front of the right eye, as well as the dark position plays a role in self-motivation and leads to replication and simulation, especially in optic anastomosis, with the dark synaptic cleft in it, which contain molecules preliminary synthesis, and on it the night plays a role in metabolic processes in humans, and moreover, all the nervous coalition such the human eye contains a coup sensor cells, raging through coincide dynamically with the phases of external influences, especially with the succession of day and night cycle, as when a plant sunflower.<br></div><div>In the optical network template established for the accumulation of constituent particles of consciousness where the line up geometric shapes (such as optical anastomosis or duplication hand&nbsp; anastomosis in the reverse direction). Any incident that the accumulation be the so-called visual anastomosis with fractional trends.<br></div><div>Quantitative identification occurs when one complements the other polymeric formations, and constitute visual anastomosis. And have processes interactions curve according to the time function draws the symbol:<br></div><div>Accordingly, complexes and even galaxies formed. And where there is a dynamic interaction At the other end sluggish or static phase.<br></div><div>At the confluence of the eye is partially interaction to be complementary molecule on the right there is a similar copy in the left. The pairing of certain molecules to form a molecule with an effective and repeater external frequencies, where the ability to stimulate other neighboring molecules can have and this is what happens all the cancer mutation. Through drawing neural genes of the human tree, we can see the imbalance and places creates mutations, (e.g., there constitute anastomosis of consciousness, which take the form of American football, as well as menorah, and the star of David within the pentagonal).<br></div><div>Or paws associated with some but in the direction of amphibolous.<br></div><div>Awareness has several recipes, including non full awareness, which is subject to the cycle time, which is divided over the quantum entanglement visual; for until it becomes integrated and aware of the senses, and therefore needs to find a complimentary, which made the brain is developing estimates of trying to find an approximate interpretation, then it produces an artificial consummated through according to previous information estimates. This is proof that sometimes the mysterious properties of consciousness. And it is both thought and schizophrenia properties of consciousness, arises schizophrenia sometimes as a result of the heart in response to frequencies influential, which seems through the synchronization of eye movement with moving at a certain phase angle, to the protein synthesis, through the Quantum intellectual energy accumulation.<br></div><div>When you look at someone from behind, we do not recognize visual information to the surface of the back of his head, despite the presence of the visual information (audio-light frequencies), in regions of the brain, but outside perceptual knowledge of the human scale, and this is what it seems when "blindsight ", where they can see that part of the dark while the normal person cannot see this dark side to those rims — which means that the rear side of the body is located within the 3-dimensional conformation (shadow), which is beyond human of perception, that is, radiation flowing in the three-dimensional structure, and this shows also that the brain may develop according to the hollow three-dimensional structure, which seems to optic chiasm and other lobes of the brain that corresponds to the optical network structure (this means that the brain is a physical infrastructure as well as the eye represents the spectral structure). Further, during the symbolic perception of information in the brain cells, that is, when you see a particular object will raging certain neurons and not others. Thus, this simulates compatibility and synchronization between the visual cells outside the brain and inside it, so the process of interactions in the brain is the secondary stage and not the initial stage for reading of consciousness, furthermore, the three-dimensional being in the eyes.<br></div><div>If the neurons that symbolizes the firing to a certain aware is in the eye, especially in a visual network, to be encoded in the brain rings; so it is a bug that may affect one matched cells functionally (of the brain and eye-sight), may result in a cluttered certain structure information, which leads to Alzheimer's, as well, which affects cellular network in the genital tract and thus lead to a lack of sexual desire, (curb sexual Energy).<br></div><div>When chewing chili it gives positive results and that is the feeling of happiness, and this shows stimulating serotonin in the blood, as well as on the nervous regulation played tongue-in-sound frequencies structure,(this means&nbsp;that the boi-interactions in the synapses of the tongue, which is as co-coalition), play a role in the coordination of the nervous regulation and hormonal regulation.<br></div><div>Can the occurrence of schizophrenia or obsessive-compulsive disorder if and only if the individual has agreed to these sound frequencies, and then the person to speak to is the ratification of the pairing. Otherwise, the influential cannot impact on the individual, because the processes of bio-synthesis based on own individual voice tag for this, we find foreign influences repeatedly inspire the individual in order to be accepted and then play those signals to control the wave on the lips of the individual for the ratification of the combined through acoustic signature. All the bio-synthesis processes that need to audio frequencies which contain the structural fingerprint. <br></div><div>As the heart plays the role of stimulus directional (cellular response) and it created forces of attraction in the form of a bio-compass which moves in accordance with the fractional&nbsp; function, (represented in tangles spectroscopy of the eye), which fractal-moves, according to the congruence structural waves heart and sight network on the one hand, with the frequencies of stimuli on the other hand, in a harmonious rhythm, (this is in the hands match, but in the reverse direction). From this conformation, we find a fork of time as well as the form of magnetic and electric fields, force directional function according to the quark flavors.&nbsp;By this quantum synapses (neural mathematics), we can manufacture high-spectral Transistor to regulate the operations of the brain as well as to restore sight and to address the phenomenon of the deaf and dumb.<br></div><div>Quantum entanglement of optic (resulting from branching fraction of optical spectra from both Iris and conjunctiva), also wavelengths are subject to filtering frequencies where they are dismantled wavelengths into multi-types, including electromagnetic, phonetic, thermal, etc. And then processed in various eye areas and not the preserve of the Iris only, but that of the conjunctiva a key role in understanding and manipulation of various wavelengths. And also there is a neurological coupling between the forest of optical spectrum and carotid artery forest, that around the eyes as well as with nerves, and bones of both the nose and cheeks.<br></div><div>Given the importance of the tongue in speech and as sound frequencies emitter, so it plays a role in bringing about synergy between the bio-functions (vision, hearing, and taste), as well as in bio-energy transfers, and the mechanism of the synthesis according to the customized sound frequencies to contribute to the regulation of the processes of the digestive system and the vagus nerve. Because the flavor of the food has a role in the memory of taste in the tongue, for this when the individual remains a long-term deal with meals lacked the salt (a normal rate of sodium chloride), would be exposed sensing cells that translates coding to and from the cells, so it is responsible for discrimination flavors cells to Alzheimer's taste and thus a gastrointestinal disturbances and physiological, and this is proof of the change in sensors structure resulting in self-reluctance of food as a dominance of certain flavor on the taste areas, and thus exposed to the blind-cognition as a result of the exercise of a particular behavior for long periods. In the end lead to the  phenomenon of illusion (blind-cognition), such sniff odors or taste the flavors or hearing voices.<br></div><div>Pentagonal molecules formed during the processes of biosynthesis, as well as when atoms are chemical elements, especially the phenomenon of allotropy. <br></div><div>Structure of the universe similar to optic structure .<br></div><div>Thought-compulsive molecules positioned in a specific area of quantum entanglement optical, and as some mysterious stuff is more than one way to be interpreted, and it is distributed representation of thought on a number of neurons in different areas of the body, and that is a functional coalition between the tongue and auditory nerve, the front part of the brain and the eye to interpret the ambiguity of negative thought. Where resorts tongue to give computations sounds (voice to end the process by accepting or rejecting), as well as the brain representation so thought, and finally the eye (which consists of the visual consort who completed the optical networking), and the eye is draw a diagram of the final structure before that travels to the brain and stores in it (because the movement of the eye is a kind of involuntary awareness, and as a result of this movement, they are structural engineering to correspond with the lobes of the brain). In order to determine the brain activity that corresponds directly to visual awareness, we suppose that there is a structural asymmetry between the lobes of the brain and tangles quantitative visual. If the issue of awareness spread over several neurons in the body where it is most concentrated in the eye. Moreover, when the individual believes that thought will affect the psychology of the individual, this should be on the individual that does not respond to such a negative thought. For this purpose, the thought-compulsive disorder is a kind of awareness of the autonomic neurons. <br></div><div>Eye contains high spectral brain, (mind), this explains the relationship between the brain and the mind.<br></div><div>There is another bio-system in human body, which is called the heart consort (inversely proportional to the stability of the heart), which automatically controls the individual speech and behaviors during a nervous breakdown, (caused by sadness, etc), especially when the individual's inability to control behaviors. We can also see this phenomenon which heart consort plays a key role in the behavior of the individual (in terms of feelings of emotions, anger, love, tolerance, etc) during anesthesia when an individual reveal his feelings for involuntary.&nbsp;Therefore It is for this consort is the ability to make individual reveal everything he thinks (every thought that occurs to the heart and brain through the senses) whether the individual under the influence of anesthesia (during surgery), or under the influence of psychological trauma (waking), and this is what leads to unrest emotional. This consort has a membrane composed of sensors sensitive electrochemical.&nbsp;That's especially this consort (The sense of neural-entanglement) plays role in determine and orientation the behavior of the individual. So it serves as a biological magnet, induces an individual to go in a certain direction. Therefore there are a heart and eye, which is associated with them in the electromagnetic more than the brain.&nbsp;<br></div><div>By saying: “treat the illness by illness”, moreover, to get rid of the negative thoughts without chemical drugs (which have effects on the nervous system) so there is a safe and inexpensive method and accessible to everyone. Mechanism that method is in accordance with the dynamic synchronization between sight and hearing and voice are as follows: To avoid the negative thought, which is harmful to the individual's behavior, we should not respond to those negative thoughts as well as not to give the speech that goes on in the our mind; because of those negative thoughts are trying to fool the cells in order to obtain the fingerprint of Sounds (computations may be wrong — leads to modified gene or protein, which in turn causes a change in behavior such as schizophrenia, delusion, obsessive-compulsive disorder) but must convince ourselves by saying "that a liar" and then move the eye at an angle in away from the nostrils and in the horizontal direction to make the geometry of the base (trapezoidal) at the front and the head is the distance between the pupils of the eyes. And thus prevent spectral structure be composed of electrochemical signals involved in the installation of gene structure and thus serve as the electromagnetic&nbsp;affinity plays a role in attracting frequencies that are similar with it.<br></div><div>&nbsp;There are spectral-viruses thermal (high IQ) invade the auditory nerve and then the low-frequency waves broadcast to be translated in the tongue, especially the right side of it, that as negative settlement.<br></div><div>Ear loves a particular style of music listening or poetry reading, according assonance of speech, text, or music. But changed it mind (Ears) when understanding the content of that text or music, etc. Further, there is another sensory controls the essence of the thing, such as analyzing and recognizing and classifying those electrochemical signals into  understandable information. this device (sensory includes both hearing and sight waves in a single template in the form of fractal waves), the functions of this sensory in passion (associated with frequencies of the heart), which is a response of its own reaction to the external stimuli. Sensor has dual-function between the polarization of frequencies and processed, as well as emitted.<br></div><div>Finally It may be this sense (the sensor) resulting from the synapses (between both hearing and sight) role in the understanding of several phenomena such as deaf and dumb as well as addiction.<br></div><h4>Acknowledgment<br></h4><div>I thank Authorea team for help, and I thank my Dad for help.
